## Projects

Click on any project title to see the detailed analysis, methodology, datasets, and final deliverables.

### 1. [Riyadh Short-Term Rental Occupancy Analysis](./Riyadh%20Rental%20Analysis)
An analysis to solve inconsistent revenue for a rental management company by tackling weekday occupancy rates that were consistently below 50%. My approach was to segment data by district, property type, and booking channel to identify specific drivers of low performance and recommend targeted pricing and marketing strategies.
* **Tools Used:** Python Notebook(pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)

### 2. [E-commerce Order Cancellation Analysis](./Ecommerce%20Cancellation%20Analysis)
A deep dive into a Pakistani e-commerce dataset to diagnose and provide solutions for a high order cancellation and refund rate (45.1%). I focused on identifying which product categories, payment methods, and time periods were most problematic to recommend precise operational improvements rather than broad, ineffective changes.
* **Tools Used:** Power BI, Excel, Python Notebook

### 3. [Student Success Analysis](./Student%20Success%20Analysis)
An analytical study to identify the key factors contributing to a high student dropout rate (31.93%). My logic was to move beyond surface-level numbers and test the statistical significance of various factors—like scholarships, parental education, and application mode—to provide actionable recommendations for improving student retention.
* **Tools Used:** Power BI, Excel, Python Notebook

### 4. [Sales Data: Python for Data Quality & Statistical Inference](./Sales%20Data%3A%20Python%20for%20Data%20Quality%20%26%20Statistical%20Inference)
A foundational project focused on the critical first step of any analysis: data preparation. This demonstrates the process of taking a raw, messy sales dataset and making it reliable for analysis by handling missing values and performing statistical validation.
* **Tools Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebook(Pandas, NumPy)

### 5. [Used Cars Sales Analysis](./Used%20Cars%20Sales%20Analysis)
*(Add a brief, compelling description for this project, similar to the others. What problem did it solve? What was your approach? What insights did you aim to provide?)*
* **Tools Used:** Power BI, Excel, Python Notebook
