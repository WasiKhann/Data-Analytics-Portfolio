# Student Success Analysis: Identifying Factors for Improved Outcomes

This project is part of my data analytics portfolio, focusing on a case study to identify key factors influencing student success and dropout rates at an educational institution. The goal was to leverage data-driven insights to develop targeted interventions and improve overall academic outcomes.

## üìä Project Overview

The institution faced a significant challenge with a **dropout rate of 31.93%** and a **graduation rate of only 49.84%**. My objective was to analyze available student data to pinpoint the most influential factors contributing to these outcomes, thereby enabling the development of effective support programs to reduce dropouts and boost graduation rates.

## üí° My Analytical Approach

My thought process involved formulating and testing several hypotheses regarding the drivers of student success. I moved beyond simple enrollment figures to conduct a deeper statistical analysis of various student attributes. My analysis specifically focused on:

1.  **Financial Factors:** Investigating the impact of financial aid, specifically scholarships, on student success.
2.  **Demographic Factors:** Examining how marital status and gender correlate with academic outcomes.
3.  **Academic Background:** Analyzing the influence of the application channel and parental education level on student success.

## üìà Key Findings & Dashboard Insights

The analysis highlighted several critical areas where interventions could have a significant impact. The insights were visualized using a Power BI dashboard (screenshots provided below).

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard immediately reveals the core problem: a **31.93% Dropout Rate** and an **Average GPA of 2.09**. These metrics underscored the urgency for data-driven interventions.

### Significant Impact of Scholarship and Marital Status

The data clearly indicates that **scholarship holders have notably higher success rates** and are more likely to graduate. Furthermore, **single students demonstrate the highest success rates**, suggesting that marital obligations may pose a significant barrier to academic performance for others.

### Parental Education as a Strong Predictor

A strong positive correlation was observed between a parent's education level and a student's success. Specifically, students whose fathers hold a **Bachelor's Degree show remarkably higher success rates** compared to those from backgrounds with lower parental education levels.

### Other Notable Insights (from report)

* **Application Mode:** The first-phase general quota showed higher success rates, particularly among females.
* **Gender:** While gender might not be a primary driver on its own, its interaction with other factors (like application mode) is noteworthy.

## üìù Recommendations and Conclusion

Based on these findings, key recommendations include:

* **Encourage Early Application:** Promote and facilitate early application processes.
* **Increase Scholarship Availability:** Expand scholarship programs to support more students.
* **Support for Married Students:** Provide additional resources for married students to help them balance responsibilities.
* **Parental Engagement:** Encourage parental involvement and provide educational resources, especially for parents with lower educational backgrounds.
* **Targeted Interventions:** Develop tailored support programs for students from less successful application modes and lower parental education backgrounds.

This analysis concludes that nearly half of the student population graduates, but dropout rates remain a significant concern. Key factors identified‚Äîapplication mode, scholarships, marital status, and parental education‚Äîsignificantly impact student success. Implementing the recommended strategies can enhance student support, reduce dropout rates, and improve overall academic success.
