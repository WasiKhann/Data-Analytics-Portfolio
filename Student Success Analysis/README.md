# Analysis of Predictive Factors for Student Success

A case study analyzing the factors that influence student success, with the goal of reducing a high dropout rate and improving graduation rates at an educational institution.

## Business Problem
[cite_start]The institution faced a significant challenge with a dropout rate of 31.93% and a graduation rate of only 49.84%[cite: 299, 300]. My objective was to use data to identify the most influential factors driving these outcomes so that targeted and effective support programs could be developed.

## My Analytical Approach
My thought process was to test several hypotheses about what drives student success. I moved beyond simple enrollment numbers to analyze the statistical impact of various student attributes. My analysis focused on:
1.  **Financial Factors:** Does financial aid (scholarships) play a role?
2.  **Demographic Factors:** Do marital status or gender impact success?
3.  **Academic Background:** Does the application channel or parental education level have a significant effect?

## Key Findings from the Dashboard

### Key Performance Indicators
[cite_start]The dashboard immediately highlights the core problem with a **31.93% Dropout Rate** and an **Average GPA of 2.09**[cite: 300, 301].

### Scholarship and Marital Status Have a Major Impact
[cite_start]The data clearly shows that **scholarship holders have higher success rates** and are more likely to graduate[cite: 304, 306]. [cite_start]Additionally, **single students have the highest count of success**, suggesting that marital obligations may be a barrier to academic performance for others[cite: 308, 311].

### Parental Education is a Strong Predictor
There is a strong positive correlation between a parent's education level and a student's success. [cite_start]Students whose fathers hold a **Bachelor's Degree have notably higher success rates** compared to those from backgrounds with lower parental education[cite: 313, 315].
