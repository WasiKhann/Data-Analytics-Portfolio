## üíæ Dataset

The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset of e-commerce transactions in Pakistan, originally containing half a million records from March 2016 to August 2018.

* **Source**: [Pakistan's Largest Ecommerce Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zusmani/pakistans-largest-ecommerce-dataset/data)
* **Data Cleaning**:
    * Removed the last five columns due to null values.
    * Eliminated empty rows.
    * For manageability and focus, the dataset was trimmed to 102,292 rows.

The cleaned and reduced dataset used for this analysis is available in this repository (`Reduced_Pakistan_Ecommerce_Dataset.csv`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Analysis & Tools

The project involved an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the creation of an interactive business intelligence dashboard.

* **Languages & Libraries**: **Python** with Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
* **Tools**: **Jupyter Notebook** for the EDA process (`pakistan-e-commerce-eda.ipynb`) and **Microsoft Power BI** for data visualization and dashboard creation.

## üìà Key Insights

The analysis of the order data revealed several critical trends:

* **High Cancellation & Refund Rates**: A significant portion of orders result in cancellations or refunds, indicating a critical area for operational improvement.
* **Payment Method Impact**: Cash on Delivery (COD) is a major contributor to order cancellations.
* **Category-Specific Issues**: Certain product categories experience disproportionately high rates of cancellations and refunds.
* **Effect of Discounts**: The effectiveness of store-wide discounts is questionable, as they may not be driving profitable sales.

## üí° BI Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following data-driven strategies are recommended to mitigate losses and improve performance:

1.  **Revise Payment Policies**: Introduce incentives for prepaid orders or revise policies for high-risk payment methods like COD to reduce cancellation rates.
2.  **Targeted Interventions**: Develop focused strategies to manage the seasonal spikes in cancellations and refunds, such as proactive customer communication.
3.  **Enhance Quality Assurance**: For categories with high refund rates, implement stricter quality checks and provide more accurate product descriptions to better align customer expectations.
4.  **Reassess Discount Structures**: Move away from broad, store-wide promotions and adopt a more targeted discount strategy based on customer behavior and product performance.
5.  **Improve Post-Sales Support**: Bolster customer service for high-value categories prone to refunds to build trust and satisfaction.
6.  **Data-Driven Inventory Management**: Utilize sales and refund data to optimize stock levels, prioritizing high-performing products.
7.  **Systematic Customer Feedback**: Implement a robust system to collect and analyze feedback from canceled and refunded orders to identify specific areas for improvement.
