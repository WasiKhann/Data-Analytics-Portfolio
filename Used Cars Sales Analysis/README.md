# Used Car Sales Analysis (OLX)

This project analyzes sales data for used cars listed on OLX to identify trends in sales volume and pricing.

## Business Problem
There was a lack of clarity on the optimal selling price for used cars.
The goal was to analyze sales performance by brand and over time to inform pricing strategies[cite: 224].
