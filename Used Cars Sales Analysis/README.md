# OLX Used Car Price Optimization Analysis

This project analyzes over 25,000 used car listings from OLX Pakistan to identify key trends in sales volume and pricing. The goal is to provide data-driven insights that can help sellers and buyers make informed decisions on optimal pricing strategies.

## üéØ Business Objective

The primary challenge addressed is the lack of clarity on optimal selling prices for used cars in a dynamic market. This analysis aims to identify how different factors‚Äîsuch as car brand, model year, and registration city‚Äîinfluence sales prices and volumes.

## üìä Interactive Power BI Dashboard

A live, interactive Power BI dashboard was created to explore the dataset and its key findings.
